LOGO SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
========================

1. Save your IsdaNary logo image as: isdanary-logo.png
2. Place it in this directory: c:\xampp\htdocs\fish_inventory\public\images\
3. The logo should be in PNG format for best quality with transparency
4. Recommended size: 200x200 pixels or larger (it will be automatically resized)

The logo has been integrated into:
- Welcome/Homepage (resources/views/welcome.blade.php)
- Dashboard and all internal pages (resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php)
- App name updated to "IsdaNary" in .env file

Once you place the logo file, it will automatically appear throughout your application!
